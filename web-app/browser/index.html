            How to play: <br><br>

            - An uncrowned player can move only towards the other
            end of the board (yellow forward and red backwards)<br><br>

            - A piece is crowned once they reach the end of the board<br><br>

            - To move, first click on the piece you'd like to move and then
            the box you'd like to move it to, if the move is legal your token
            will be placed there<br><br>

            - To jump a piece you must click on the piece you'd like to move then 
            click on the open space where the piece would land after you jump it<br><br>
            
            - To cancel a double jump, click above or below the square where the piece
            would land after its initial jump<br><br>
